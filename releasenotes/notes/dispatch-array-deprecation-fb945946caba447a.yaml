    The ``array`` and ``dispatch`` submodules of Qiskit Dynamics have been deprecated as of version
    0.5.0. The use of the ``Array`` class is no longer required to work with different array
    libraries in Qiskit Dynamics, and is broken in some cases. Refer to the user guide entry on
    using different array libraries with Qiskit Dynamics. Users can now work directly with the
    supported array type of their choice, without the need to wrap them to enable dispatching. The
    ``array`` and ``dispatch`` submodules will be removed in version 0.6.0.
