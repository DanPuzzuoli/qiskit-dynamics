    Adds JAX fixed-step solvers implemented with parallelized commands. Solvers are
    available through :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.solvers.solver_functions.solve_lmde`
    and hence through calls to :meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.solvers.solver_classes.Solver.solve`.
    Parallelized options are ``'jax_RK4_parallel'`` and ``'jax_expm_parallel'``. These solvers
    are only recommended for use with GPU.
