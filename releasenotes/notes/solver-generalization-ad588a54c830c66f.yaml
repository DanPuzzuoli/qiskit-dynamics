upgrade:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.Solver` class has been modified to no longer
    internally store signals: rather than passing them at instantiation, or setting them
    via the ``signals`` property, ``signals`` must be passed as an argument to the
    ``solve`` method when solving. Setting ``signals`` at instantiation or through the
    property has been deprecated (see deprecations). A new instantiation argument,
    ``rwa_carrier_freqs``, has been added to control behaviour of the rotating wave
    approximation in the absence of signals being specified.
  - |
    The ``solve`` method of :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.Solver` can now be made to perform
    lists of simulations by specifying one or more of the ``t_span``, ``y0``, and ``signals``
    arguments as lists of valid single inputs. This supports specifying all as a list of the
    same length (with a different value for each to be used in each simulation), or a subset
    can be specified with lists of the same length, with the other arguments giving only a single
    value (to be used repeatedly while varying the other parameters). Results are returned as a
    list of the results of the individual simulations.
deprecations:
  - |
    Storing signals in the :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.Solver` class has been deprecated:
    The ``hamiltonian_signals`` and ``dissipator_signals`` constructor arguments are deprecated,
    and the ``signals`` property is deprecated. Signals must now be passed directly to the
    ``solve`` method. These arguments and property will be removed in the next major release.
  - |
    The :meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.Solver.copy` method has been deprecated and will be removed
    in the next release.
