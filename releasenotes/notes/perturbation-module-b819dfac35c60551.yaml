prelude: >
    Adds perturbation theory sub module for computing and utilizing multi-variable power series
    expansions commonly used when studying quantum dynamics, e.g. Dyson series and Magnus expansion,
    and the generator of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation.
features:
  - |
    Adds :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.perturbation.ArrayPolynomial` for representing
    multi-variable array-valued polynomials.
  - |
    Adds function :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.perturbation.solve_lmde_perturbation` for computing
    Dyson series and Magnus expansion terms for solutions to linear matrix
    differential equations.
  - |
    Adds data container class :class:`qiskit_dynamics.perturbation.PerturbationResults`
    for storing and accessing the results of
    :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.perturbation.solve_lmde_perturbation`.
  - |
    Adds class :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.perturbation.PerturbativeSolver`, which implements
    specialized fixed-step solvers for linear matrix differential equations,
    based on the Dyson series and Magnus expansion.
  - |
    Adds function :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.perturbation.schreiffer_wolff` that computes
    a multi-variable expansion for the generator of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation.
other:
  - |
    Adds ``multiset`` package as a dependency.
