    or ``0.4.6``, it is necessary to set ``os.environ['JAX_JIT_PJIT_API_MERGE'] = '0'`` before

    A warning has been added to :class:`.InstructionToSignals` class when converting pulse schedules
    to signals to notify the user if the usage of ``SetFrequency`` or ``ShiftFrequency`` commands 
    result in a digital carrier frequency larger than the Nyquist frequency of the envelope sample
    size ``dt``.
