    Adds JAX sparse evaluation mode to models and
    :class:`qiskit_dynamics.Solver`.
    This mode can be enabled by setting the ``evaluation_mode`` to
    ``'sparse'`` while `:meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.default_backend` is set to ``'jax'``
    This evaluation mode is only recommended for use on CPU unless
    the arrays are extremely sparse.
  - |
    Adds additional fixed-step solvers implemented with JAX. New solvers are
    ``'jax_RK4'``, available through :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.solvers.solver_functions.solve_ode`
    and parallelized solvers ``'jax_RK4_parallel'`` and ``'jax_expm_parallel'`` available
    via :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.solvers.solver_functions.solve_lmde`. The parallelized solvers
    are only recommended for use with GPU.
